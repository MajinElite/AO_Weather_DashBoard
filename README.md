## Weather Dashboard Project  
Created by Ammar Osmun

This project is a Python based weather dashboard that pulls live data from a free weather API and displays it through a simple graphical interface. The goal is to learn how real applications are structured, how data moves through different parts of a program, and how to connect Python to real world services.

The app includes features such as reading API data, converting the response into useful values, and showing it inside a GUI window. Over time the dashboard will expand with better visuals, error handling, and configuration options.

## What I will learn while building this project

Working on this application teaches several important skills that can be used in larger projects later. This includes:

- How to work with Python APIs, including sending requests and reading JSON data  
- How to use JSON files for saving and loading settings  
- How to create a config system for API keys and user options  
- How to build a Python GUI using Tkinter  
- How to structure code into functions, files, and stages of development  
- How to clean up and polish a project for real use  
- How to read API documentation and understand the data they return  
- How to work with libraries like requests and pandas if needed for conversion or formatting  
- How to think in terms of a full app flow rather than writing isolated code
